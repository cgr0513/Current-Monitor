This is the Current Monitor/Current buffer circuit at the planning stage.
Currently, no fuse or safety circuit limits are current for AUV.
The inductor smooths out the current change, and the capacitor connects to the ground when there is a significant current spike from shorting or a fuse breaking.

At this stage, the initial plan is to connect the inductor and capacitor with the resistor without a PCB connection. More research will be required to find the most feasible and economically reasonable.
